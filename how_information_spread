The SIR model is a mathematical model in the form of a system of differential equations used in the field of epidemiology used to model the spread of infectious diseases, with three groups:

S (Susceptible): Individuals who are susceptible to infection
I (Infected): Individuals who are spreading the infection
R (Removed): Individuals who have recovered and are no longer infectious, Individuals who have left the system (died). 

In the context of information dissemination, these categories are modified to:

Total Observed Population = U + A + B

U (Unaware): Don't know the information
A (Aware): Knowing & actively spreading
B (Bored): Already know, but no longer spreading

dU/dt = - δUA (1) 
dA/dt = δUA - εA (2) 
dB/dt = εA (3)

Just like a disease, information spreads through contact between individuals (in this context via social media).
Unaware can become Aware if they meet Aware.
Over time, Aware can become Bored because they are bored or no longer relevant.
